// Tower of God THEORY: BAAM and secret of powers within him. 
The Theory itself is about Powers in Baam and the theory itself is on season 01.  
But a good theory starts from a through research so those will be in their sections below. 
This includes information from 2 sources 
1) Tower of God story itself and I have provided extact issue numbers
2) SIU's earlier story Talse User Universe
So lets begin .. hope you like it. 
01 ) The Theory 
  => There are 2 powers inside Baam that are connected to SUI's earlier story - Talse User Universe. 
  => 1) The Blue Demon and 2) The Sun Entity 
  => The Sun is the power of 'GOD' that Oedipus was trying to create. 
  => The Blue Demon is the power of The Conquering King
02) Baam's Rebirth in Tower of God [Season 2 Episode 240]
=> Baam was orginally the son or Arlene and V 
=> He was born on The Floor of Death 
=> Jahard tracked Baam down and killed him infront of Arlene 
=> Arlene eventually found a way outside the tower and Graham found the following in Arlene's diary store inside her pocket 
"i decided to offer this child's body to the god on the outside. Someday the god's power will enter this dead child's body and awaken him again. "
=> Jahard decides to create his shrine in The Floor of Death ( where Baam was born) and force people to pray him
=> This causes the arrival of Enryu (Season 2: 240-241 ) who kills Jahard followers, then the administrator, and leaves the thorn and is never seen or heard from again. 
04) Talse Userz and SIU's past story 
=> SIU had an earlier story called Talse Userz story 
=> The story talks about Exis, which among other thing, includes a complete manipulate of space around themselves. 
=> This is called their 'exis influence' 
=> We are also told of a dead Exis called the Conquering King
=> Conqeuring King is known for raging endless war 
=> Oedipus, a powerful axis, is trying to create a GODm and this somehow involves the second coming of the conquering king. 
=> Oedipus story is sadly cut short because SIU stopped publishing the story. 
[ Theory is, Oedipus is the god of the outside to whom Arlene offered Baam.]
05) Powers inside Baam the Blue Devil and the Red Sun 
=> Season 2 episode 148 While chasing Rachel, Baam ends up over using the power of thorn and goes berserk.
=> Other than a huge power boost, Baam starts hearing a voice  that orginally says "this is only a part of the power".
=> Baam hears a voice few more than but where the voice is coming from is finally revealed in Season 2: 170 as being the Blue demon inside Baam. 
=> Blue Demon asks Baam to release himself to the outside and in return Baam will get the power to "....become the king that will make everything kneel before you , and rule over them."
=> In more than one occasions, including against a fight with Data Jahard, Baam demonstrates power to manipulate space.
=> In TOG narrative though, the only entities known to be able to control space itself is The Administrators. 
[ 
  Theory is, The Blue Demon inside Baam is none other than The Cnquering king himself. 
  The power to manipulate space that Baam keeps showing is actually a manifestation of his axis ability. 
  The power is currently in infancy. 
]
06) The SUN 
=> Season 2: 170 Baam rejects Blue Demon's offer
=> He says ** word for word on how its on webtoon **
" Those who try to step over someone else and go up higher are actually only running away from some fear that they cannot see. 
Trying to step over someone is a cowardly act. 
It means you are not confident enough to face the opponent and speak to them with the same viewpoint. 
It does not matter how much power I have in me I do not want to become such a cowardly person. 
I will fight and get hurt in order to survive at least at the same place with everyone else by using that power that is taking over you. "
*** we see what looks like a sun burning brightly behind the blue devil. 
Blue Demon is The Conquering King, and knows one thing rule all others. 
But Baam's rejects his power, because Bam is just not the rebirth of the Conquering King. 
Conqering King is just 1 ingredient, what Baam was meant to be is A GOD. 
The GOD power is however the sun.
PULLING IT ALL TOGETHER
==================
Outside Tower of GoD live multiple Exis. 
One of whom is Oedipus trying to create a god. 
Arelene wanted vengence and offered Baam's dead body to Oedipus. 
Oedipus among other thing used the power of The Conquering King to ressurect Baam. 
The Conquering King, at least some vestiage , is still within Baam in the form of the Blue Devil. 
But that is all drawfed by Baam's true power, the power a the GOD that Oedipus was trying to create, which manifests as the Sun. 
As this is god's power this is where Baam is randomly drawing lines and pulling powers from. 
He also has ability to manipulate space which is often confused as the ability of the administrator, but it's actually something much bigger .. the power of an exis - it's just in its infancy. So watch out !!
