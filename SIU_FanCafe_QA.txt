Headon forgot to give Baam the Pocket. So how were they able to have conversations? (09/06/2010)
A: If I answer this it would be a spoiler.. 
So I cannot give you a clear answer. 
You will eventually get the answer as the story progresses.
PS. Thank you for finding things I kept hidden well. Thank you


Will Baam become the king of the tower? (07/26/2010)
A: Well ^^ If you know it now, it won’t be interesting. 
So I won’t tell you. 
(If I can provide you some hints, the king of the tower is a bit different from how you think of the kings)
