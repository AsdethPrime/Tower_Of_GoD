Headon forgot to give Baam the Pocket. So how were they able to have conversations? (09/06/2010)
A: If I answer this it would be a spoiler.. 
So I cannot give you a clear answer. 
You will eventually get the answer as the story progresses.
PS. Thank you for finding things I kept hidden well. Thank you


Will Baam become the king of the tower? (07/26/2010)
A: Well ^^ If you know it now, it won’t be interesting. 
So I won’t tell you. 
(If I can provide you some hints, the king of the tower is a bit different from how you think of the kings)

When ToG was in the Best Challenge section, Headon said to Baam,“I truly welcome you for coming to the tower. 
The boy who was born on the night that tower cried.” 
Why was this line erased?(09/12/2010)
A: This line has some foreshadowings, but I took it out because it might give too much confusion in the beginning.

Question about the King Jahad’s influence (10/21/2010)
A: Without spoilers, the king of the tower, as the title says, is the king of the tower.
He is the one who made the society of the current tower. 
Much of the relationship between the Floor Guardians and Jahad is kept secret. 
However, it is correct that the one who made the current method of testing are Jahad and Headon. 
Not much is known about previous tests. 
And those who climb the tower as regulars are all under Jahard’s influence. 
There are many people who work for Jahad after becoming Rankers. 
And since the entire tower is under the King Jahad and 10 houses’ influence, even Rankers cannot live ignoring them.
For the world above 135th floor, you can see it as a whole different world ^^
