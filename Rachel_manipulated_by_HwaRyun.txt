Manhwa Ref: Season 2 Episode 156 

Rachel ( to Hwayrun): You said you would teach me the way to be the heroine when you were guiding me. 
But it was a lie. 
The hero you chose was Bam and I was just bait to make him go up the tower. 
But I have found the way to become a heroine myself. 

HwaRyun: .. what ?

Rachel: It's nothing special. 
If I wasn't born to be the heroine from the begining, all I needed was people who'd send me to the top of the tower. 
In this awful darkness, I will find the one who will walk for me. 
If I'll go blind I will find the one who will see for me. 
If my thorn breaks I will be the who will be my Thorn. 
All I need to do is find them. 
The Guy behind the door right now Hoaqin is the one who will be my first thorn.
