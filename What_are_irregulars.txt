01 Those who open the gate
Manhwa Ref: Season 1 Episode 2 

Baam: You keep saying that I'm an irregular, what is that?
Yuri: It's a name for those who open the gate and enter the tower on their own. 
The irregulars aren't chosen to enter the tower. 
This tower is only meant for the choosen. 
But on rare occasions, irregulars like you who weren't chosen find their way in.
