01 Yuri explains who is an irregular
Manhwa Ref: Season 1 Episode 2 

Baam: You keep saying that I'm an irregular, what is that?
Yuri: It's a name for those who open the gate and enter the tower on their own. 
The irregulars aren't chosen to enter the tower. 
This tower is only meant for the choosen. 
But on rare occasions, irregulars like you who weren't chosen find their way in. 

02 Leroro Explains what's an irregular
Manhwa Ref: Season 1 Episode 10 

Leroro [ To Baam ] : The irregulars are those who go against the rule of the tower. 
..., this tower can be divided into three areas.
There is a residential area called the 'outer tower', 
the test arena of the regulars called the 'inner tower', 
and a middle area. 
It is normal for residents of the tower to be born in the resident area, 
and live on that floor for their entire lives. 
But some people of a particular class can go to the other floors through the inner tower or the middle area. 
That's for regulars. 
...
In the case of regulars they live in the residential area, and one day show enough talent to earn the right to enter the inner tower. 
There are other cases too, but all of them were chosen that's what they have in common. 
The sorting of the regulars is done by Headon, the administrator of the tower. 
And all the regulars who have been sorted will eventually gather here ( Floor 2 - Floor of Test). 
However very rarely people who weren't sorted get here. 
They are the irregulars.
