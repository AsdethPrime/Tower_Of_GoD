// TOG Theory: Rachel destiny has always been to kill Baam 

1.0 INTRODUCTION
=> If you are an anime only fan and do not wish to be spoiled, this post is not for you 
=> If you are expecting a full proof theory, that has no holes - this is also not for you
=> You will find more holes than a swiss cheese so you have been warned though hopefully you will find it interesting ðŸ™‚ 
2.0 The Theory 
=> The resurrected baby ( Baam ) was feared as a monster 
=> His destined to someday devour the tower 
=> That is why Baam was locked up in a cage from which he could not escape 
=> Rachel likely went to kill Baam in the cave, and hence has a knife with her
=> But seem Baam's innocence could not bring herself to kill Baam 
=> Over time we are slowly hearing Baam story and looks like the destiny of Baam may not be to replace Jahard 
=> But rather erase the existence of Tower of God Forever. 
Now that takes care of introduction and the theory itself lets detail this 
a) Rachel wants to see the stars [ Season 1 Episode 1 ]
Baam: Where are you going?
Rachel: I am going up the tower. 
Remember what I told you Baam?
I can get to the outer world if I get to the top of the tower. 
I will see blue sky during the day, and starlight at night...
b) This dream was not orginally hers but something she copied from a different person ( guess: Arlene Grace)
Manhwa Ref: Season 2 Episode 240 
Wagnan: ... What on earth are you going to such troubles to gain? ...
Rachel: .... Is simply a blue sky, countless stars and a cool breeze. 
That ridiculously beautiful view which that person wanted for the entire life.
If only I may be able to see that sight myself I would be satisfied with that. 
Wagnan: ..? What are you talking about ? That person ?
Rachel: hehe You don't need to know 
c) Arlene Grace had the same dream [Season 2 Episode 240 ]
Garam telling events from Arlene's diary: 
"I have finally found a way to get out of this place.
A place without Jahad or the administrator. 
I don't know where that place will be but as long as I can see the vast sky and shining stars which are so much like my own home it doesn't matter.
d) Garam tells Baam she is unsure if he could really call Arlene his mother [ Season 2 Episode 240 ]
Baam: ... When you say that she brought me into this world, do you mean she is my mother ?
Garam: .. could you really call her a mother? I am not sure about that
Baam: What ?
Garam: She's been here longer than I have so I'm no sure about the exact details. 
What I'm sure of is that she played a crucial role in bringing you to this place. 
e) Garam a second time tells Baam he is NOT really Arlene's child  [ Season 2 Episode 240 ]
Garam: ... as he ran away, within Arlene's body yet another life was waiting to be born. 
Baam: You mean that baby was .. ?
Garam: No that child was murdered by Jahard. 
f) When Arlene talks about Baam's profecy she first uses "my child" to refer to the dead kid but to what gets resurrected
 [ Season 2 Episode 240 ]
Garam ( retelling from Arlene's pocket ): 
But even as I was leaving this place I could not let go of the longing for my love and the pity for my dead child.
So I decided to offer this child's body to the 'God' on the outside. 
Someday that god's power will enter this dead child's body and and awaken him again. 
THAT CHILD will open the door to this tower and return someday. 
// My tidbits 
=> Both Garam and Arelene don't appear to be calling the resurrected child as Arlene's child 
=> Garam first question if you could call Arelene the mother of Baam as we know in the story 
=> Garam also expressly correct Baam when he asks if he is the child, saying that child was murdered by Jahard 
=> Arlene address the child as 'her child' till the child is dead but 'THAT CHILD' once the child is resurrected 
=> I interpret this as the child being reborn is no longer Arlene's child - that kid is dead 
=> What's reborn is the God on the outside 
g) Rachel says Arlene called Baam a monster ( would any mom ever call their child a monster ? )
Manhwa ref: Season 2 Episode 313 
Rachel ( while talking to Baam):
But you don't know anything. 
In fact no one here knows anything about you. 
I am the only one who knows about you.
Aren't you curious Bam ?
Don't you want to know why you were trapped in that cave?
.. continued next episode [ Season 2 Episode 314 ]
Baam: But how you said you didn't know anything ?
Rachel: I was lying. I did not want to tell you the truth. 
Do you think you were born to come here, defeat Jahard and become the hero that would change this tower?
No Bam, you weren't born for that.
You weren't born to save this tower. 
You are a monster born to curse this tower and devour everything. 
Arlene always called you a monster. 
h) Baam could not get out of the cave on his own and when Rachel came to see him she HAD A KNIFE on her hand 
Manhwa Ref: Season 1 Episode 54
Baam ( talking to himself): 
All I knew was there was a light above. 
I built a tower of rubble to go beyond that light. 
But when I reached it I finally realised that I would never get out of here .. 
** We see Baam trying to push up the ceiling of the floor but is able to open it **
.. and that somebody beyond that light had locked me in the deep and lonley darkness. 
I cried. 
Realizing I was alone was even more painful than dropping a rock on my foot while building the tower. 
But then the ceiling moved; and a miracle happened. 
That's when I realised it was beautiful to be a living human. 
** We see Rachel enter carrying a knife **
i)When Baam give Rachel complement's she looks SHOCKED rather than happy 
Baam: Rachel, about the world beyond that light, you said only the choosen people can live there right ?
** Rachel looks shocked **
Baam (continues) : I guess I am not one of the chosen ones. 
.....
** Rachel still look shell shocked while Baam continues 
Baam: Rachel, you are like the light to me. 
You came to me who wasn't one of the choosen people. 
If I go up there, will I be able to make friends with more angel like you?
