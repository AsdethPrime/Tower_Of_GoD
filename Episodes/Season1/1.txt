We see Baam running behind Rachel on what looks like a cave 
Rachel drops on the ground, and Bam asks her where she is going.
Rachel: I am going up the tower. 
Remember what i told you, Bam?
I can get to the top of the tower I will see blue skies during the day, and starlight at night. 
So I am going up the tower. 
I am sick of living in this dark world. 
I am sorry Baam forget about me. 
Let me be reborn again. 

While Baam shouts don't go. 

We then see the tower door open; 
Door has a drawing of a tower, a sun on top of it, and some clouds around it. 
We also see something glowing brightly on the top.

Both Rachel and Baam are pulled inside. 
*** In anime, we actually see the door open twice. 
Once only Rachel is taken and the door closes leaving Baam outside. 
Then Baam opens the tower door
=======================

Baam then wakes up on Headon's floor. 
We see there are 2 walls, with 2 set up arts. 

# In Manga 
Wall has 3 people 
1) Looks like a guy made of cloud/ smoke 
2) A flying dragon and a person 
3) A man wearing a helmet with a horn

# In anime #
Wall 1 has the art of 3 people; we see this wall in detail in anime
1) What looks like a horse with wings 
2) A bearded person wearing a robe and 
3) What looks like a flying dragon

In manga we see another wall with 3 people , in this issue we only see 2 of them
1) What looks like a Bee 
2) What looks like half man, half lion with a bone on the head.

=> We see looks like Man and an animal similar to Rak 

=> Then we see a pair of glowing eyes ( whose eyes are these?? )
=> Then we see light 
=> Followed by a glowing cross , like that of Jesus 
=> Headon shows up saying
=> Headon wears a dress that has a cross sign on it 
=> And carries a weird weapon that has a stick and 2 balls on either end 
=> Headon asks for his name, he repies name is 25th Baam 

## In anime Headon directly addresses him as Baam and Baam is surprised Headon knows his name 

=> Baam asks if he has seen Rachel go past here 
=> Headon says the typical whatever you wants you find at the top - climb up 
=> He also tells Bam the journey will be hard and painful 
In manga we then see a giant eye behind Headon [ this was not shown on anime so perhaps not as important ]
=> Headon tells Bam he has to complete a test to climb

=> The test escape the Steel Eel and break the ball
=> Headon says "the ball ... is designed to pop when hit hard enough"
=> To pass the test you need to 
go inside the bar, defeat or outrun the monster, and pop the app to pass the test 
=> Headon tells Baam that this is mating season for steel eel and hence they are very aggressive 
=> Headon asks Baam if he is afraid ?
=> Baam does not reply 
=> Headon tells him , if he is afraid he can't pass the test and never find the girl he is looking for 
=> Headon continues, a girl alone in this tower, it sure makes me worry 
=> Headon also then tells him "It is almost impossible for you to pop that ball"
=> Taking the test is sucide; rather than doing that, forget all this and move on with your life 

=> Baam desides to take the test, Headon smirkes and says 
"Welcome to the tower Mr. Baam"
