Baam: Where are you going ?

Rachel: I am going up the tower. 
Remember what I told you Bam ?
I can get to the outer world if I get to the top of the tower. 
I will see blue stars during the day, and starlight at night. 
So I am going up the tower. 
I am sick of living in this dark world. 
I am sorry Bam, forget about me. 
Let me be born again. 

Baam: No.. No Rachel. 
No don't go Rachel. 
Please don't do this. 
...
If you go I will follow you until I die.
