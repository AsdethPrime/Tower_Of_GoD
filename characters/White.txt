// similarities between Baam and White

Let me start with Baam, using mostly facts but a few guesses: 
(1) Baam escaped his first "death" and got preserved by magic spells and 
(2) sealed away in some dark cave, for 
(3) some unknown period of time until 
(4) Rachel finds him and 
(5) attempts to convert Baam into a tool for her own purposes (via how she educates Baam and so on); 
(6) Baam has some kind of special, scary "absorption" skill--how he learns techniques--and also 
(7) Baam winds up with at least one "demon" inside his body, and 
(8) that demon is always tempting Baam to go down a darker path; finally 

Now look at White/Hoaquin: 
(1) White escaped his first "death" and was preserved by magic spells and got preserved by magic spells and
(2) sealed away in some dark cave train, for 
(3) some unknown period of time several hundred years until 
(4) Rachel and her team find him and 
(5) attempt to convert him into a tool sword for her own purposes; 
(6) White/Hoaquin uses a special, scary soul-"absorption" skill--how he learns techniques powers himself up and also 
(7) White/Hoaquin has at least one "demon" in his body and 
(8) that demon is always tempted already tempted White/Hoaquin into going down a very dark path; finally 


Aside from all that we get basic symbolism stuff:
- Baam is associated with night/darkness/etc., 
- and everyone who sees his powers at full bloom comes away thinking "what a little monster" 
(even if they think of Baam as a "good guy"); White is associate with white/light/etc., 
- and everyone who sees is powers at full bloom comes away thinking "wow, that's so beautiful!" 
(despite knowing he's a bad guy).

// Both Baam and white have more potential than a high ranker
"Next chapter is finally the Hoaqin vs Baam ultimate showdown.

Both of them have potential, greater than that of a high ranker, so this fight may change the fate of the Towerâ€¦?"
