[ Season 2 Episode 229 ]

Rachel: 'You're pretty depressed for someone who's inherited the blood of Jahard.'
Wagnan[ who looks shocked says]: What are you...!

Rachel [ holding the jahard ring on her hands]: 
This. 
This is your ring right?

Wagnan: Why do you have that ring?
Rachel: Don't worry the others don't know about this. 
Especially not Hoaqin. 
I know a bit about it. 
What this ring means. 
Because I know one other person who has a ring like this. 
You guys are the fatal weak point point that Jahard tried to hide but ultimately survived. 
You've gained powers that you were not supposed to have 'Prince of red light district'.
