// Motivation [ Manhwa Season 2 Episode 229 ] 

God of the Guardian [ talking to Baam ] : ...
Long ago, some child asked me something like that. 
To teach him how to become the king of the tower. 
When I asked the boy why he needed such power, this is how he replied. 

[ We see some person in darkness - presumably young Jahard] :
I want to turn this tower into a place where everyone can live happily. 

God of the Guardian [ continues] : 
I helped him grow stronger and he really did get stronger. 
And ultimately he became the king of the tower. 
But in the end that child failed to make everyone happy. 

I don't know exactly what happened but a lot of things changed after he left this place. 
I may not know everything in this world, but I am sure of one thing, 
having tremendous power won't make everyone happy around you.

// Baam is similar to Jahard but also different [Manhwa Season 2 Episode 229 ]

God of the Guardian [ talking to himself after hearing Baam wants to become a god]:
He seem's similar but he is different. 
And yet this boy is different from Jahard. 
Jahard wanted power in order to stand above others and change them. 
But his boy simply thinks he needs the power in order to stay with them.
