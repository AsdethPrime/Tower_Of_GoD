// Motivation [ Manhwa Season 2 Episode 299 ] 

God of the Guardian [ talking to Baam ] : ...
Long ago, some child asked me something like that. 
To teach him how to become the king of the tower. 
When I asked the boy why he needed such power, this is how he replied. 

[ We see some person in darkness - presumably young Jahard] :
I want to turn this tower into a place where everyone can live happily.
