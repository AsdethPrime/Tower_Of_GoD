// Motivation [ Manhwa Season 2 Episode 299 ] 

God of the Guardian [ talking to Baam ] : ...
Long ago, some child asked me something like that. 
To teach him how to become the king of the tower. 
When I asked the boy why he needed such power, this is how he replied. 

[ We see some person in darkness - presumably young Jahard] :
I want to turn this tower into a place where everyone can live happily. 

God of the Guardian [ continues] : 
I helped him grow stronger and he really did get stronger. 
And ultimately he became the king of the tower. 
But in the end that child failed to make everyone happy. 

I don't know exactly what happened but a lot of things changed after he left this place. 
I may not know everything in this world, but I am sure of one thing, 
having tremendous power won't make everyone happy around you.
