Chapters 0-10:
=> introduced to Rak on the floor of tests, Evankhell's Hell.
=>  first selection game was to reduce the number of incoming regulars from 400 to 200.
=> In response to this test, the majority of regulars begin to fight to the death. 
=> We first see this when Rak encounters Levin (That sniper guy).
=> Instead of killing Levin he throws him to the side, takes his rifle and tosses it off a cliff.
=> Rak then begins to survey the field for any regulars that are worth hunting.
=> Rak shows off his animalistic senses as he is able to see the most powerful regulars at a glance.
=> He even notices the overwhelming power coming from Anak's Green April. 
=> he's able to sense the Black March.
=> Rak then decides to hunt the Black March instead of Green April
=> This scene shows that Rak may be headstrong, but he still knows his limits.
=> Rak admits that the Green April would be difficult to hunt.(Season one ep 6).
=> Khun suggests forming a group of three, Rak laughs remarking that Khun and Baam are nothing but his prey
=> Rak then explains what he means by "hunt" to Baam.
"To hunt- is to make myself stronger. I push through the powerful shinsoo and tear off and eat the skin of the strong!!!!! That way I make their strength mine!! So I only fight against strong enemies. I came here to find rivals that can make me stronger!!" (Season one ep 8).
=>  First, the line: “I push through the powerful shinsoo” serves as evidence that Rak’s species swim through Shinsoo to hunt
=> Rak claims that eating the flesh of powerful opponents will make their strength his.
=> It isn’t known if Rak is being literal, or figurative here


// From Wiki and SIU's blogs
=> Wraithraiser is the name of Rak's species.
=> why they are called Wraithraisers?
=> they hunt turtles and that anything that is not a Wraithraiser is called a turtle
=> Wraithraisers possess increased shinsoo resistance due to having to swim in high-density Shinsoo while hunting
=> we know that Rak's wish is "Something that transcends them all."(Season 1 chapter 0)
=> Rak's wish is something greater than Money, revenge, honor, pride, authority and power.
