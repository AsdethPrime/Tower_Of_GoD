01) Maschenny is a genius
// From the blog
In the blog post for Season 2, Chaoter 198 SIU mentioned the following: 
"Since he (Ran) has Khun Maschenny bloodline, he has the "genius" trope as well.

// Interpretation 
- Just because Ran is from Maschenny bloodline, he is automatically a genius 
- So if Maschenney's whole bloodline is strong, you would expect the same to be true for Maschenney.
- Few more evidences will follow but its been made pretty clear Maschenney's bloodline is one of the strongest if not downright the strongest bloodline from Khun family.
