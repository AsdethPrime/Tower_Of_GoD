00) Well off the bat, 1st evidence she is very powerful; she is among top 100 rankers.

01) Maschenny is a genius
// From the blog
In the blog post for Season 2, Chaoter 198 SIU mentioned the following: 
"Since he (Ran) has Khun Maschenny bloodline, he has the "genius" trope as well.

02) Maschenny bloodline is stronger and smarter than Khun's (AA) 

// SIU Tweet Translation from 2016
Koon should have been a direct descent based on the principle, but her mother’s bloodline isn't so good, so it is hard for him to be included among direct descents… Case by case… Kind of..
Maschennies have it stronger and stuff… It’s just the way Koon is :)

3) Maschenny-style Lightning Spear technique is considered one of the most OP technique (within Khun family)

// From the blog (season 2 Chapter 47)
"The Maschenny-style Lightning Spear technique that Ran uses is a Lightning Style technique invented by Maschenny Zahard"
...
It's a technique that turns shinsu into a spear,
so it grants the advantage of being able to take the Spear Bearer position without being armed with spears.
(Compared to ordinary shinsu manipulation techniques,
Lightning Spear techniques are much faster and have higher accuracy.)
As it allows one to participate in both short and long-range battles,
it is considered to be one of the 'ultimate spear techniques'.
