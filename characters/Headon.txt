HEADON
=======
### Theory # 1: Headon wants to overthrow Jahard Rules 
Question: 
Why would Headon wanna overthrow Jahard?
We are told by SIU Headon and Jahard created the current testing system together?

REASON 
 => Because Jahard seeks to do what is forbidden in the tower: manipulate fate for one's advantage
 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
Theory # 2 ( odd one) : Headon actually is an irregular 

REASON 
 => He seems very different from other guardians 
1) Can move to any floor of the tower 
2) Seems to have human emotions
3) He has a really humanoid shape and a reasonable size

=> He seems a bit too keen on Irregulars 
1) Regulars never visit his floor - it's exclusive to testing irregulars? 
2) Only admin that no regular can form a contact with
=> He helped both Baam and Rachel
=> Baam got black march - that got him noticed by key players in the story Khun and Raak 
=> Rachel got Ghost, FUG's support ( who went far enough to steal Hell Train for her )
=> Rachel actually recognized Headon as 'the fairy' of the tower she knew of him
=> That makes Headon the only admin that has a 'name' and is actually popular to people outside


The actual theory
=> Headon was a irregular that entered long ago
=> He reached the top of the tower, and in doing so gained respect of all floor administrator
=> He became the tower ruler above all admins
=> But deep down he was not satisfied 
=> So he pretended to be the tower guardian to see, if any irregular, like him will come to the tower 
=> First came Enryu; who peaked Headon's interested 
=> SIU in his blog mentioned he was frantically looking for Enryu 
=> Then someone else entered the tower, Phantaminium, someone too powerful for Headon to challange 
=> This further peaked his interested, and currently he is manipulating Baam with the hope of gaining something that will allow him to challange someone like Phantaminium

// He seems a bit too keen on irregulars
=> he lives on floor 1 so he can test every irregulars that enter the tower
=> SIU also mentioned at one point, Headon was keenly looking for Enryu
=> Headon appear to have Helped both Baam and Rachel climb the tower 
=> Rachel got:
1) Support from FUG
2) Power Ally ( Ghost )
3) FUG even stole the helltrain for her 
4) Got her Emily etc. etc. etc. 

=> What did Baam get:
1) Black March for Yuri , which not only let him completed first test 
2) Black March was the reason 2 key people got attracted to him
a) Khun 
b) Rak 
3) Also caused a princess ( Anak ) to survive Jahard assasin , who is also Baam's friend 

// Headon's connection with FUG
=> Headon said he would help Rachel climb the tower, but FUG has been the organization assisting Rachel all this time. 

// HanSung Yu
=> Hansung Yu's back story he was expecting an Irregular to enter the tower and bring change. 
=> He used this info to convince Evankhell and she killed former Administrator so they could take over. 
=> His data also convinced of comming of son of Arlene to Khun Eduna 
=> How he a D-Ranked Regular knew this information ??
=> Hansung Yu working together with Headon to manipulate FUG to write the correct destiny for Baam 


// Connection with Gustang
=> Gustang says in chapter 340: The second thorn has been delivered, and I have that "pawn" a gift of mine.
=> At the end of the Workshop Battle Gustang is again contacted and he asks about the real Prince of Jahad
=> One who will clear the Tower's last test. 
=> Headon is working with Gustang to get Bam the second thorn fragment 

(from SIU's blogs), Gustang already knows the way to exit the tower
