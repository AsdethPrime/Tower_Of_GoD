HEADON
=======

// From Cannon
=> Let her move to the floor of tests,
=> put Ghost at her side to help her climb and stealing the Hell Train for Rachel through FUG 
=> Headon told Rachel:  The person the tower chose ... it's not you.
=> headon points out how ugly, nasty and bad of a person she is
=> he gives her the test to show why she's not the one chosen by the tower. 
=> Headon takes Rachel's hope of climbing the tower by telling her she was not the one chosen and 
=> Daring her to take the test which she doesn't take because if she's dead, how can she see the stars? 
=> Headon points out it didn't matter if Yuri helped him or not because he would have taken the test one way or another. 
=> Headon is making Bam out to be what Rachel believes he is [a monster, her enemy ].

=> Headon makes her an offers to make a deal with her to make her the "Heroin" of the story and that is exactly what she wants.
=> She wants to be special, she's a human after all.
=> But what is that deal? 
=> What is that Favor Headon wants from her? 

// Theories
=> Having Yuri lend him the Blackmarch was the plot used by Headon to take care of the assassin Jahard has sent 
=> and making sure the 2 princesses survive 
## Why are the princesses import to Headon ? ##
## Why are his actions anti Jahard ?? ##

=> Headon must know Jahad has started to change fate and destiny itself. 


// HanSung Yu
=> Hansung Yu's back story he was expecting an Irregular to enter the tower and bring change. 
=> He used this info to convince Evankhell and she killed the former Administrator on the Floor of tests so they could take over. 
=> His data also convinced of comming of son of Arlene to Khun Eduna 
=> How he a D-Ranked Regular knew this information ??
=> Hansung Yu working together with Headon to manipulate FUG to write the correct destiny for Baam 


// Why is Rachel trained by FUG
=> Next we find out Bam has been trained by FUG, and then we find out Rachel is being supported by FUG also. 
=> This is weird, no? Why is Rachel being helped by FUG?
=> They even stole The Hell Train itself for her 
=> Why is someone like Gustang helping her ?
=> Gustang says in chapter 340: The second thorn has been delivered, and I have that "pawn" a gift of mine.
=> At the end of the Workshop Battle Gustang is again contacted and he asks about the real Prince of Jahad
=> One who will clear the Tower's last test. 
=> Headon is working with Gustang to get Bam the second thorn fragment as well as help Rachel out to become a more useful pawn
