HEADON
=======

Theory # 1: Headon wants to overthrow Jahard Rules 

Question: 
Why would Headon wanna overthrow Jahard?
We are told by SIU Headon and Jahard created the current testing system together?

REASON 
 => Because Jahard seeks to do what is forbidden in the tower: manipulate fate for one's advantage
 
// He seems a bit too keen on irregulars
=> he lives on floor 1 so he can test every irregulars that enter the tower
=> SIU also mentioned at one point, Headon was keenly looking for Enryu
=> Headon appear to have Helped both Baam and Rachel climb the tower 
=> Rachel got:
1) Support from FUG
2) Power Ally ( Ghost )
3) FUG even stole the helltrain for her 
4) Got her Emily etc. etc. etc. 

=> What did Baam get:
1) Black March for Yuri , which not only let him completed first test 
2) Black March was the reason 2 key people got attracted to him
a) Khun 
b) Rak 
3) Also caused a princess ( Anak ) to survive Jahard assasin , who is also Baam's friend 

// Headon's connection with FUG
=> Headon said he would help Rachel climb the tower, but FUG has been the organization assisting Rachel all this time. 

// HanSung Yu
=> Hansung Yu's back story he was expecting an Irregular to enter the tower and bring change. 
=> He used this info to convince Evankhell and she killed former Administrator so they could take over. 
=> His data also convinced of comming of son of Arlene to Khun Eduna 
=> How he a D-Ranked Regular knew this information ??
=> Hansung Yu working together with Headon to manipulate FUG to write the correct destiny for Baam 


// Connection with Gustang
=> Gustang says in chapter 340: The second thorn has been delivered, and I have that "pawn" a gift of mine.
=> At the end of the Workshop Battle Gustang is again contacted and he asks about the real Prince of Jahad
=> One who will clear the Tower's last test. 
=> Headon is working with Gustang to get Bam the second thorn fragment 

(from SIU's blogs), Gustang already knows the way to exit the tower
