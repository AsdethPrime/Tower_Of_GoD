=> Real name Akryung. 
=> Headon gave him to Rachel, at least in part to help her pass the Floor of the Test
=> s1e77, about halfway through "The Company" translates this as Headon having “prepared” Ghost
=> Ghost, Endorsi and Rachel slaughtered every other regular in 30 minutes in the first Floor of the Test
=> REf: end of chapter s1e13
=> Yu Hansung found this highly problematic 
=>  Yu Hangsun s1e14 used the crown game as an excuse to merge the groups. 
=> During the crown game in s1e25 Ghost briefly scares Bam out of immediately reuniting with Rachel while doing nothing else.
=> He also easily passed the early-spearbearer pass test in s1e29,
=> This inspires Rak to train relentlessly until he could do so as well.
=> Rak thinks "that tin can is no fun at all" while waiting with him during the hide-and-seek test in s1e52. 
=> Akyrung doesn't do anything, just ignores the order to shoot and sits there in the final test in s1e69.
=> Then we didn't see him once in all of Season 2
=> We saw somebody making animal noises that had been found by Michael and Apple before their (seemingly fruitless) search for Rachel at the last station in s3e1..
=> and now it's practically confirmed that was him.

// Argument for not being irregular

Argument 1: Endorsi appear to be able to sense when she sees an irregular but can't sense that from Ghost

=> Endorsi talks about Rachel s1e27: “she feels like someone ‘who lived in a different world,’”
=> Season 2 - 205 Endorsi tells Baam" Both you and Rachel look kind of weird to my eyes, though" 
=> Endorsi knew Ghost for a while "the huge one was already with me" in s1e27
=> Endorsi didn’t sense any irregularness from him on floor 2 like she did for Bam and Rachel. 
Also minor tidbit
=> God of the Guardian in season 2 - 169: also accurately discerns that Bam's an irregular
=> Appears this "irregular-detecting-senses" definitely exist in this universe


Argument 2: Headon Prepared Ghost, how can he prepare an irregular?
=> s1e77 is translated by The Company as Headon having “prepared” Ghost
=> We didn’t see him come in
--has Ghost just been sitting on 1F for years getting no attention in spite of his irregularity?
// Counter argument to this
=> Headon could have made a test that ghost could not pass when he entered the tower 
=> If an irregular fails the first test, what happens?
=> We know its not as easy to find way outside ? 
=> Perhaps Headon knowing kept the irregular with a deal for being his servant in exchange for being allowed to climb
[ Or perhaps a deal similar to what Khun was going around offering people on first test ]

Argument 3: SIU SORT of called him special regular
“Akryeong uses Shinwonryu. 
Although the possibility of Akryung being an Irregular came up in S1, 
but whether he is really an irregular or what... 
that's to be seen later. 
Since now that Baam can't fight normal regulars anymore, 
we'll see more "special" regulars like Akryeong, Princess, or Sorcerers” outright calls him a “special regular;” 

Counter argument against what SIU said:
=> 'special regular' could merely be referring to 'people that are climbing.'
=> Baam is also often story wise referred to as a regular at times to show he hasn't reached the top yet
=> I highly doubt that SIU would be silly enough to say 'whether or not he's an irregular will be shown later, btw he's a regular'.

Argument 4: We have seen non-irregular use Shinshoo Blackhole ( God of the Guardian) 
=> God of Guardians (who was created by the workshop and is definitely not an irregular) : Season 2 episode 231
=> GOG also mentions that he can only do it on the train. 

// Sinshoo Backhole creation merely requires special authority
s2e230: “Ordinary regulars are granted authority to control shinsu from administrators,
but you must realize that you have had that authority from the very start. 
Make this space your own. 
Because that is the privilege of ‘those who open the door.’ 
You must realize that to master Shinsu black-hole sphere.”

=> So the kind of authority over shinsoo required to create back hole regulars do not have 
=> But GOG is not an irregular he does have it though
