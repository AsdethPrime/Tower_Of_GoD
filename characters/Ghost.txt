=> Real name Akryung. 
=> Headon gave him to Rachel, at least in part to help her pass the Floor of the Test
=> s1e77, about halfway through "The Company" translates this as Headon having “prepared” Ghost
=> Ghost, Endorsi and Rachel slaughtered every other regular in 30 minutes in the first Floor of the Test
=> REf: end of chapter s1e13
=> Yu Hansung found this highly problematic 
=>  Yu Hangsun s1e14 used the crown game as an excuse to merge the groups. 
=> During the crown game in s1e25 Ghost briefly scares Bam out of immediately reuniting with Rachel while doing nothing else.
=> He also easily passed the early-spearbearer pass test in s1e29,
=> This inspires Rak to train relentlessly until he could do so as well.
=> Rak thinks "that tin can is no fun at all" while waiting with him during the hide-and-seek test in s1e52. 
=> Akyrung doesn't do anything, just ignores the order to shoot and sits there in the final test in s1e69.
=> Then we didn't see him once in all of Season 2
=> We saw somebody making animal noises that had been found by Michael and Apple before their (seemingly fruitless) search for Rachel at the last station in s3e1..
=> and now it's practically confirmed that was him.

// Argument for not being irregular
=> Endorsi didn’t sense any irregularness from him on floor 2 like she did for Bam and Rachel. 
=> (when explaining why Endorsi teamed up with Rachel in 28s1e27), “she feels like someone ‘who lived in a different world,’”
