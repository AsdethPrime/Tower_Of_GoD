The Huge guy had already been with me. 
anyways, WHEN I FIRST SAW HER I FELT THAT I SHOULDN'T FIGHT HER. 
That's why I decided to team up with her for now.

Anak: You felt that you shoudn't fight her. 

Endorsi: Yeah it's hard to explain. 

Anak: Is she that strong?

03 Rachel tells Khun about her dream to reach the top of the tower and see stars
Rachel: Have you heard about the legend of the top of the tower?
Khun: The top of the tower?
Do you mean the legend that says you can see the real sky and stars when you get to the top of the tower?

Rachel: Yes.
Since the time i first heard about it when I was young I always dreamed about myself watching the stars at the top of the tower. 
Everytime I close my eyes , I saw the infinite sky with numerous stars
** We see Rachel on top of the tower and we see the sky and stars 
It was so beautiful even in my imagination that I wondered if I might go blind if I saw it in person. 
Just the thought of it made my heart pound.
My one goal in life is to reach the top of the tower someday. 
....
Even now, I can see the stars when I close my eyes. 
Such beautiful light feels my heart and I can't sleep at night.
