// The desire to see the stars is a dream Rachel copied from somewhere
Manhwa Ref: Season 2 Episode 240 

Wagnan: ... What on earth are you going to such troubles to gain? ...

Rachel: .... Is simply a blue sky, countless stars and a cool breeze. 
That ridiculously beautiful view which that person wanted for the entire life.
If only I may be able to see that sight myself I would be satisfied with that. 

Wagnan: ..? What are you talking about ? That person ?

Rachel: hehe You don't need to know 

// Earlier in the same issue [ Season 2 Episode 240 ]

Garam tells Baam what she found in Arlene's pocket ( after Arlene's kid was murdered in front of Baam )

Arlene: I have finally found a way to get out of this place. 
A place without Jahard or the administrator. 
I don't know where that will be but as long as I can see the vast sky and the shinning stars which are so much likely my own home, it doesn't really matter."

// My intepretation
=> For whatever reason Rachel decide to copy Arlene's dream
