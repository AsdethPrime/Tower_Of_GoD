// Rachel wants to see the stars [ Season 1 Episode 1 ] 

Baam: Where are you going?
Rachel: I am going up the tower. 
Remember what I told you Baam?
I can get to the outer world if I get to the top of the tower. 
I will see blue sky during the day, and starlight at night...


// The desire to see the stars is a dream Rachel copied from somewhere
Manhwa Ref: Season 2 Episode 240 

Wagnan: ... What on earth are you going to such troubles to gain? ...

Rachel: .... Is simply a blue sky, countless stars and a cool breeze. 
That ridiculously beautiful view which that person wanted for the entire life.
If only I may be able to see that sight myself I would be satisfied with that. 

Wagnan: ..? What are you talking about ? That person ?

Rachel: hehe You don't need to know 

// Earlier in the same issue [ Season 2 Episode 240 ]

Garam tells Baam what she found in Arlene's pocket ( after Arlene's kid was murdered in front of Baam )

Arlene: I have finally found a way to get out of this place. 
A place without Jahard or the administrator. 
I don't know where that will be but as long as I can see the vast sky and the shinning stars which are so much likely my own home, it doesn't really matter."

// Rachel is also somehow convinced she is the one to fulfill Arlene's dream [ Season 2 Episode 240 ] 

Rachel ( talking to herself ) : Arlene, I don't care what Baam is to you. 
I am the one from the legend who will obtain the thorn and make your wish come true. 
It has to be me.
