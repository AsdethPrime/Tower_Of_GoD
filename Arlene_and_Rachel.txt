Manhwa Reference: Season 2 Episode 240 

Baam: When you say that she brought me into this world, do you mean she is my mother ?
Garam: Could you really call her a mother? 
I am not sure about that. 
She's been here longer than I have so I'm not sure on the exact details. 
What I am sure of is that she played a crucial role in bringing you to this place. 
She was one of the irregulars who entered the tower along with the ten great family leaders.
