// Rachel wants to see the stars [ Season 1 Episode 1 ] 

Baam: Where are you going?
Rachel: I am going up the tower. 
Remember what I told you Baam?
I can get to the outer world if I get to the top of the tower. 
I will see blue sky during the day, and starlight at night...


// The desire to see the stars is a dream Rachel copied from somewhere
Manhwa Ref: Season 2 Episode 240 

Wagnan: ... What on earth are you going to such troubles to gain? ...

Rachel: .... Is simply a blue sky, countless stars and a cool breeze. 
That ridiculously beautiful view which that person wanted for the entire life.
If only I may be able to see that sight myself I would be satisfied with that. 

Wagnan: ..? What are you talking about ? That person ?

Rachel: hehe You don't need to know 

// Earlier in the same issue [ Season 2 Episode 240 ]

Garam tells Baam what she found in Arlene's pocket ( after Arlene's kid was murdered in front of Baam )

Arlene: I have finally found a way to get out of this place. 
A place without Jahard or the administrator. 
I don't know where that will be but as long as I can see the vast sky and the shinning stars which are so much likely my own home, it doesn't really matter."

// Rachel is also somehow convinced she is the one to fulfill Arlene's dream [ Season 2 Episode 240 ] 

Rachel ( talking to herself ) : Arlene, I don't care what Baam is to you. 
I am the one from the legend who will obtain the thorn and make your wish come true. 
It has to be me. 

// Rachel knew about the Tower as well as Headon [ Season 1 Episode 76 ]
Rachel [ talking to herself upon seeing Headon ] 
Am i inside the tower ?
Is that the fairy of the tower ?

Rachel [ now talking to Headon ]
Mr Fairy is that you ?
I have read about it in a book. 
There is a fairy that leads kids up the tower. 
You must be that fairy. 
I'm Rachel!
I am here to climb up the tower 

// But Headon does not know her [ Headon response - Season 1 Episode 76 ]
Headon: It's not you. 
Rachel: Huh ?
Headon: I said, it's not you. 
The person that the tower choose is not you. 
Rachel: What .. what do you mean ?
I've always dreamt of going up the tower and now I'm here. 

Headon: It's not you. 
Don't fool me your liar. 
You already know how ugly, nasty, and how bad you are. 
You were not chosen.
[ Rachel at not point actually argues ]

Rachel: No .. there is no way .. Fairy please. 
Please give me a change fairy. 
I need to go up the tower, it's my only hope. 
 ... 
 
[ Headon then gives her a test she can't past and Rachel responds ] 

Rachel: ... How can I escape from the big monster and pop the ball ?
You just want to kick me out because I am not the chosen kid.
