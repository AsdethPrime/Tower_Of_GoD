// Rachel wants to see the stars [ Season 1 Episode 1 ] 

Baam: Where are you going?
Rachel: I am going up the tower. 
Remember what I told you Baam?
I can get to the outer world if I get to the top of the tower. 
I will see blue sky during the day, and starlight at night...


// The desire to see the stars is a dream Rachel copied from somewhere
Manhwa Ref: Season 2 Episode 240 

Wagnan: ... What on earth are you going to such troubles to gain? ...

Rachel: .... Is simply a blue sky, countless stars and a cool breeze. 
That ridiculously beautiful view which that person wanted for the entire life.
If only I may be able to see that sight myself I would be satisfied with that. 

Wagnan: ..? What are you talking about ? That person ?

Rachel: hehe You don't need to know 

// Earlier in the same issue [ Season 2 Episode 240 ]

Garam tells Baam what she found in Arlene's pocket ( after Arlene's kid was murdered in front of Baam )

Arlene: I have finally found a way to get out of this place. 
A place without Jahard or the administrator. 
I don't know where that will be but as long as I can see the vast sky and the shinning stars which are so much likely my own home, it doesn't really matter."

// Rachel is also somehow convinced she is the one to fulfill Arlene's dream [ Season 2 Episode 240 ] 

Rachel ( talking to herself ) : Arlene, I don't care what Baam is to you. 
I am the one from the legend who will obtain the thorn and make your wish come true. 
It has to be me. 

// Rachel knew about the Tower as well as Headon [ Season 1 Episode 76 ]
Rachel [ talking to herself upon seeing Headon ] 
Am i inside the tower ?
Is that the fairy of the tower ?

Rachel [ now talking to Headon ]
Mr Fairy is that you ?
I have read about it in a book. 
There is a fairy that leads kids up the tower. 
You must be that fairy. 
I'm Rachel!
I am here to climb up the tower 

// But Headon does not know her [ Headon response - Season 1 Episode 76 ]
Headon: It's not you. 
Rachel: Huh ?
Headon: I said, it's not you. 
The person that the tower choose is not you. 
Rachel: What .. what do you mean ?
I've always dreamt of going up the tower and now I'm here. 

Headon: It's not you. 
Don't fool me your liar. 
You already know how ugly, nasty, and how bad you are. 
You were not chosen.
[ Rachel at not point actually argues ]

Rachel: No .. there is no way .. Fairy please. 
Please give me a change fairy. 
I need to go up the tower, it's my only hope. 
 ... 
 
[ Headon then gives her a test she can't past and Rachel responds ] 

Rachel: ... How can I escape from the big monster and pop the ball ?
You just want to kick me out because I am not the chosen kid.

// Baam and Rachel mention giant mountains where the 3 eyes symbols are present 

Manhwa Ref: Season 2 Episode 150 

Rachel: ... You said you are going to the mountain in the west today.
And also the cliff where the three eyes are looking down on us. 
Baam: Ok .... frankly speaking, it's not a mountain though 
Rachel: What are you talking about?
I have never seen such a huge mountain!
Maybe the world behind this place is much bigger than we thought!

Baam: Even bigger than the world above?
Rachel: emm world above...

Baam: Rachel, about the world beyond that light, you said only the choosen people can live there right ?
** Rachel looks shocked **
Baam (continues) : I guess I am not one of the chosen ones. 
.....
** Rachel still look shell shocked while Baam continues 

Baam: Rachel, you are like the light to me. 
You came to me who wasn't one of the choosen people. 
If I go up there, will I be able to make friends with more angel like you?


// Some people have theorised this is how the Baam's cave connects with the TOG

// Leroro explains Baam about the Tower 
Manhwa ref: Season 1 Episode 10

Leroro: ... this tower can be divided into three areas.
There is a residential area called the "outer tower", the test area of regulars called the "inner tower" and a middle area. 
It is normal for residents of the tower to be born in the residential area, and live on that floor for their entire lives.
But some of the of a particular class can go to other floors through the inner tower or the middle area. 
....
In the case of regulars they live in the residential area ( outer tower) and one day show enough talent to earn the right to enter the inner tower.
There are some other cases too ... but all of them are choosen that's what they have in common. 
...
The sorting of regular is done by Headon the administrator of the tower. 
And all the regulars who have been sorted eventually gather here. 
However, very rarely people who weren't sorted get here. 
They are the irregulars. 

// Rachel tells Baam about night that are scared of, and the night they want to see
Manhwa Ref: Season 1 Episode 28
Rachel ( while talking to Baam) : Bam do you know what is at the top of the tower ?
...
At the top of the tower there is something called the sky.
...
There is a wide sky and the stars rise when the night falls. 
It's not the night that we are scared of. 
It's the beautiful night, the real night. 
I will go there for sure one day. 

// First time Rachel came to visit Baam she had a knife in her hand 
Manhwa Ref: Season 1 Episode 54

Baam ( talking to himself): 
All I knew was there was a light above. 
I built a tower of rubble to go beyond that light. 
But when I reached it I finally realised that I would never get out of here .. 
** We see Baam trying to push up the ceiling of the floor but is able to open it **
.. and that somebody beyond that light had locked me in the deep and lonley darkness. 
I cried. 
Realizing I was alone was even more painful than dropping a rock on my foot while building the tower. 
But then the ceiling moved; and a miracle happened. 
That's when I realised it was beautiful to be a living human. 

** We see Rachel enter carrying a knife **
