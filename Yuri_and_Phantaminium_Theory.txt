Argument 1:  Yuri seem to find out an irregular has entered the tower before Evan. 

// From direct cannon 

Manhwa reference: Season 1 Episode 2 

Evan: My Lady, what are you trying to do on the first floor?
Yuri: An irregular has stepped in the tower!
He has opened the gate himself. 
Evan: Whaaat ?? Are you sure ?

// My interpretation
=> Evan is the guide, the one who is supposed to have limited pre-cognition 
=> So you would expect he would know things before Yuri 
=> But that's opposite of what happened in the second episode
=> Yuri is the one who knows an irregular has opened the door before Evan
=> How ?





Argument 2:  Yuri while talking to Pedro already knew Baam would win and survive because according to Yuri:
"...that's how it was meant to be since a long time ago" 

// From Direct Canon

Manhwa reference: Season 2 Episode 193

Pedro: That doesn't matter. 
We have Yura Ha on our side, and she can use teleportation. 
Regardless, the only people who would die would be Jue Voile Grace and his companions.

Yuri: Sorry, but Bam's not going to die, mustache. 
I know better than anyone. 
There is no way he will die. 
He will make his way to survive and come see me. 
BECAUSE THAT'S HOW IT WAS MEANT TO BE SINCE A LONG TIME AGO. 

// My interpretation 
=> I argue this is because a long time ago Phantaminium had foretold Yuri about this a long time ago
