Argument 1:  Yuri while talking to Pedro already knew Baam would win and survive because according to Yuri:
"...that's how it was meant to be since a long time ago" 

Season 2 Episode 193 [ 38F - Hell Train: The Dallar Show ]

Pedro: That doesn't matter. 
We have Yura Ha on our side, and she can use teleportation. 
Regardless, the only people who would die would be Jue Voile Grace and his companions.

Yuri: Sorry, but Bam's not going to die, mustache. 
I know better than anyone. 
There is no way he will die. 
He will make his way to survive and come see me. 
BECAUSE THAT'S HOW IT WAS MEANT TO BE SINCE A LONG TIME AGO.
