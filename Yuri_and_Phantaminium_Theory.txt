Argument 1:  Yuri seem to find out an irregular has entered the tower before Evan. 

// From direct cannon 

Manhwa reference: Season 1 Episode 2 

Evan: My Lady, what are you trying to do on the first floor?
Yuri: An irregular has stepped in the tower!
He has opened the gate himself. 
Evan: Whaaat ?? Are you sure ?

// My interpretation
=> Evan is the guide, the one who is supposed to have limited pre-cognition 
=> So you would expect he would know things before Yuri 
=> But that's opposite of what happened in the second episode
=> Yuri is the one who knows an irregular has opened the door before Evan
=> How ?


Argument 2: Yuri decide to help Baam, by givin him a forbidden weapon, the consequence of which is death

// From direct cannon 
Manhwa reference: Season 1 Episode 2 

Headon [talking to Yuri ]: Actually lending weapons is against the rules - but if you'll lend him the Black March I will allow it. 
...
Yuri [ Talking to Bam ] : Take this. 
This is Black March, I'll lend it to you for a while. 
Evan: Lady Yuri , you can't do that. 
How can you lend something like the Black March?
...
You will be killed if the King finds out. 

// My interpretation
=> So Yuri sees Baam
=> She doesn't seem to know anything about him other than he is an irregular
=> Yet despite being directly warned that lending Baam Black March could get her killed, she still decides to help Baam 
=> Would you risk your life to help someone you don't even know ? Even if it could mean your death?

Argument 2.1 : We are also told Yuri did not know about Arlene or Baam being Arlene's child 

// From direct canon 

Manhwa reference: Season 2 Episoide 258 

Yuri talking to herself:
I've heard that the leader of Poe Bidau family is very interested in our world. 
But I never imagined that he would be keeping track of Baam's activities.
By the way, why did he call him "Son of Arlene"?
Who on Earth is Arlene ?

// Interpretation 
=> Seem clear she did not know Baam's mother either 
=> This makes the act of Yuri helping Baam even odd. 




Argument 3:  Yuri while talking to Pedro already knew Baam would win and survive because according to Yuri:
"...that's how it was meant to be since a long time ago" 

// From Direct Canon

Manhwa reference: Season 2 Episode 193

Pedro: That doesn't matter. 
We have Yura Ha on our side, and she can use teleportation. 
Regardless, the only people who would die would be Jue Voile Grace and his companions.

Yuri: Sorry, but Bam's not going to die, mustache. 
I know better than anyone. 
There is no way he will die. 
He will make his way to survive and come see me. 
BECAUSE THAT'S HOW IT WAS MEANT TO BE SINCE A LONG TIME AGO. 

// My interpretation 
=> I argue this is because a long time ago Phantaminium had foretold Yuri about this a long time ago
