Baam [ Talking to himself ] :
Ever since I came in here something feels strange. 
It feels like a strong force is flowing into me from somewhere. 

02. Whatever this was is appears pretty powerful, and was shoved into Baam by FUG
=> Manhwa Ref Season 2 Episode 43

Baam: 7 years ago when I joined the FUG a man said that he would teach him how to become a god. 
** flashback starts

Baam: God you say ?
Jinsung Ha: Yes god. 
The power to make all wishes come true, change the world, or throw that all aside and walk your own path.
I can only give you the smallest part of it now but this power will help you choose your destiny. 

*** we see Baam inside the Wine Glass approach what looks like a long red energy. 

** flashback ends 

Baam: As soon as I laid eyes on the read light, I was struck with great pain and I fainted. 
And when I woke up I felt it inside of me. 
I asked about it later but they would not answer me.
All I know is that FUG secretly hid it on the floor of the test , 
and made a huge tank to take care of it. 
And that water inside it is very special, 
it makes Shinheuh that goes inside it huge, 
or enhance one's power to control shinshu, for example. 
Abnormal things happen in there.
