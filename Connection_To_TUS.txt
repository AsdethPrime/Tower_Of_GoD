We also had lots of instances of "virtual worlds" or "dream worlds", 
where only a thin link held our protagonists to the "real world" which usually is The Tower itself.

The Name hunt station = Only names matter.

The 43rd Floor = Only souls matter.

the Virtual Floor = Only completing data quests matters.

// TUS Story 
People in Rosemadder's Third Petal are trying to create a true God, because even Axis have limitations
In GoDai's translations, the world is called "Rosemadders 3rd petal".
So people theorise the main axis is someone called Rosemadder 
[ Hendo Lok Blood Madder being somehow related to him and his connection to TOG ]
