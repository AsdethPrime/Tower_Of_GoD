Bunny's translation of TUS and background story: https://www.reddit.com/r/TowerofGod/comments/7ugkoe/tus_translation/

Often the theorised top 5 axis users are as follows [IN NO PARTICULAR ORDER ]: 
1) Phantaminium 
2) King Of Conquest [ Conquering King ]
3) King of National Salvation 
4) Rosemadder [ and Duke of Rosemadder work from him ]
5) King of Artificial Creation [ Odepius ] => At least looks wise looks similar to Rachel and is a female

We also had lots of instances of "virtual worlds" or "dream worlds", 
where only a thin link held our protagonists to the "real world" which usually is The Tower itself.

The Name hunt station = Only names matter.

The 43rd Floor = Only souls matter.

the Virtual Floor = Only completing data quests matters.

// TUS Story 
People in Rosemadder's Third Petal are trying to create a true God, because even Axis have limitations
In GoDai's translations, the world is called "Rosemadders 3rd petal".
So people theorise the main axis is someone called Rosemadder 
[ Hendo Lok Blood Madder being somehow related to him and his connection to TOG ]
