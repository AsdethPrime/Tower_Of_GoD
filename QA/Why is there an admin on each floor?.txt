The rule orginally was that Guardinas of the tower conducted the test 
This changed 
Mr. Lero after he mentions the infamous Phantaminum and Urek(irregualrs) in season 1 Ep 57 such as

"Through these incidents , 
the great rulers of the tower realized that their precious tower could be brought down by others, 
if individuals were to enter with a score to settle(those like Anak) 
or with mysterious powers (Those like Bam), 
the balance of power could tip. 
If the malcontent minority becomes stronger than the ruling elite, 
the tower's peace can be shattered by chaos. 
The rulers came to a decision, 
here at this place where the regulars first take the test, 
they would weed out those who posed a danger to the tower and keep them from continuing.. 
Real purpose is to keep the tower from chaos"
